<h1>Hi, I'm Vasudha </h1>
I'm a computational science student with a strong drive to combine and enhance my IT skills for climate protection. My focus lies in projects aimed at reducing computational power and increasing energy efficiency. This passion led me to the world of high-performance computing and the critical importance of using computing systems as efficiently as possible.

My experience as a working student involved the analysis and visualization of complex research data. This role offered me insights into both frontend and development, an exciting intersection I'm eager to delve deeper into.
